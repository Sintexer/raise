## Introduction
Raise is a service where you can either create or pass tests. Community created content
is being moderated, so you won't see any obscene content. Also, there are comment
sections for each test, so you can share your opinion with other users.

Each test is specified by an arbitrary set of four characteristics:
- Memory
- Logic
- Calculations
- Reaction

So, when you pass the test, result will affect the performance of your personal
characteristics set. This is how statistics are kept. Statistics cen be viewed in 
user profile.

## General info

Time for passing the test is not limited. After the end of testing user will see its result and 
questions, where he made a mistake. Even semi-correct answers can bring points.

Subject rights in applications are specified by the set of permissions. For example, 
to confirm the test, you must have "confirm:test" permission. Subject permissions set
is known from subjects roles set. Each role has specified suite of permissions. 

#### Roles

  new result will be saved only if it's greater than previous. 
    - Сan write comments. 
    - Сan see other users profiles and edit his own profile.

## Requirements

To run this project you will need:
- JDK 14 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Maven - for building sources
- Tomcat - for starting server

Other dependencies will be downloaded by maven
___
## Build

First you need to install and start PostgreSQL server. Then you should run sql scripts
from `/sql` folder:
- `1_drop_database.sql` - will drop `raise_db` if it exists
- `2_create_database.sql` - will create the `raise_db`
- `3_create_tables.sql` - will fill `raise_db` with tables and enums
- `4_init_tables.sql` - will fill `raise_db` tables with some content, such as superuser,
  test categories and directly by tests.
- `5_create_user.sql` - will create `raise_user` and grant permissions to it

For build, you should start maven in project root directory and build `war` file 
using maven war plugin. This plugin dependency is specified in `pom.xml`: `<packaging>war</packaging>`.

`mvn compile war:war
`

Now `raise.war` will appear in project target directory. You should move that
archive to the Tomcat `/webapps` folder.

After that, you need to start application server using Tomcat and access it through
web browser.

### Building at the Intellij IDEA

After clone from github, create `Tomcat 9.0.40` configuration. 
Click `fix` button and choose `raise_war_exploded`. 

Note that application path should be `/`. To do so in IntelliJ IDEA go to `Edit configuration`
And at then, in deployment, change application context.

![app-context2](readme/app-context2.png)

If application can't run, check if all dependencies are downloaded and libraries are added to `lib` folder. 
You can check that at `Project structure -> Artifacts -> raise:war exploded -> Available Elements (on the right)`

___
## Testing

Some tests require test database. So, if you need to run project tests, create
`raise_test_db` by scripts from `/sql/test_db` folder. Run them in order of their names.

After creating and filling this database, nothing can stop you from running tests.

___
## Usage
After running webapp in Tomcat container, you can start using application. 
To start, you can register or try to pass tests without authorization. If you choose
to register, then click on `Sign up` button at the top-right corner and fill up the
registration form. After sending a form, you must confirm your email. Todo so, follow
the link from your email inbox. Maybe check spam folder. After that, simply login in 
to your new account.

If you don't want to register, you can log in to any of prepared accounts. 

### Prepared accounts
To log in 
as **admin** try email: `admin@gmail.com` with password: `121212`.

To log in as simple user, 
try email:`user@gmail.com` and password:`121212`.

### Changing locale
Raise application is localized to **English US**, **Russian** and **Swedish**. You can 
change locale anytime by clicking on the globe button at right side of navbar. Then choose 
preferred language in the modal window.

### Passing test
To past the test you first need to choose it. You can view all the tests in the catalog.
Link to catalog is signed as `Tests` at the navbar. When choose a test, 
first you will see test preview there are described some test parameters and comment 
section also will be here. To start testing, click `Start testing` button.

After finishing the test, you will see test result page. If you are authenticated, your
results also will be saved.

### Creating test
To create test, follow to the constructor by clicking `Constructor` link at the navbar.
There you can dynamically form test. When test is complete, submit it and wait until 
an admin confirm it.

### Administrating the application
If you have admin permissions, then `Admin panel` button will appear at your nav. At the
admin panel page you can confirm or ban new tests. Admin panel provides some information

landing.evolve=Evolve
landing.evolve.info=We tried to create a system for development, in which there will be nothing superfluous. All tests are moderated, and a simple interface will not let you get confused. Therefore, nothing will distract from working hard.
landing.constructor=Create new
landing.creator.info=Each user can become a test author. To start you just need to want. Embody your ideas, share experiences, get to know yourself as a creator.
button.create.test=Create test
landing.progression=Track your progress
landing.progression.info=Each task evaluates an arbitrary set of 4 of the following characteristics: Memory, Logic, Computation and Response. Therefore, passing the test also raises your score on these scales. The score obtained depends on the difficulty of the test. The results can be seen on your profile.
landing.progression.sub.info=Below are descriptions of each of the characteristics separately.
landing.memory=Memory
landing.memory.info=Memory shows how efficiently you store the knowledge you have acquired. Can be assessed by simply asking the theory passed. Memory can be long-term and short-term. The test can check any of the memory types.
landing.logic=Logic
landing.logic.info=The logic parameter is an assessment of the work of your object-connection mechanism. How quickly can you calculate the height of a nearby skyscraper? Can you find the answer to a puzzle you've never solved before? The answer to these questions is determined by the parameter of your logic.
landing.calculations=Calculations
landing.calculations.info=This is an assessment of your ability to count. And not only numbers, but everything countable. This characteristic includes tasks for the knowledge of mathematics in the fields of algebra and geometry. This will also include various tests for transferring from one number system to another.
landing.reaction=Reaction
landing.reaction.info=In general, this is an assessment of your resistance to stress. If the test puts you in front of unexpected questions, looks for weak points and is replete with tricks, perhaps the author wants to know how you react to all this.
landing.comment=Don't be shy
landing.comment.info=If you are at a dead end, do not understand the question, or find an error, do not hesitate to use the comments. Unfortunately, we cannot always answer everyone. But other members of our community can help you.
link.login=Login
link.register=Register 
landing.start.now=Start now
landing.start.now.info=You can take your first test even without registration. However, then the system will not be able to remember your successes.
landing.impulse=Keep the momentum
landing.impulse.info=For better memorization, practice regularly. It is also possible to re-pass the test. The statistics takes the best result.\
Unfortunately, the memory is not perfect. Any knowledge gained tends to be forgotten. Therefore, it is important to constantly keep yourself in good shape and remember: what quickly flies in, then quickly flies out.
button.go.up=Go up
test.catalog.search=Search
test.catalog.search.info=Using the search, you can find a test by name or by category. Searching by name will return tests whose names begin with the same characters. Searching by category will display all tests of the corresponding category. If you select the parent category (in bold), tests will be shown whose categories are inheritors of the selected one.
test.catalog.new=New tests
landing.new.tests=New tests
MEMORY=Memory shows how efficiently you store the knowledge you have acquired. Can be assessed by simply asking the theory passed. Memory can be long-term and short-term. The test can check any of the memory types.
LOGIC=The logic parameter is an assessment of the work of your object-connection mechanism. How quickly can you calculate the height of a nearby skyscraper? Can you find the answer to a puzzle you've never solved before? The answer to these questions is determined by the parameter of your logic.
CALCULATIONS=This is an assessment of your ability to count. And not only numbers, but everything countable. This characteristic includes tasks for the knowledge of mathematics in the fields of algebra and geometry. This will also include various tests for transferring from one number system to another.
REACTION=In general, this is an assessment of your resistance to stress. If the test puts you in front of unexpected questions, looks for weak points and is replete with tricks, perhaps the author wants to know how you react to all this.
